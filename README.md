# 100 Years of Baby Names in British Columbia

**Under heavy construction!** I've just started this fun little project and right now the repo is mostly exploration and brain dumps. Lots of cool stuff (and less messy code) is coming soon!

Interactive visualizations of baby names in British Columbia from 1915 to 2014. The data includes every first name that was chosen five or more times in a given year, and is published by the British Columbia Vital Statistics Agency. Raw data was downloaded from:

- https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/most-popular-girl-names-for-the-past-100-years
- https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/most-popular-boys-names-for-the-past-100-years
